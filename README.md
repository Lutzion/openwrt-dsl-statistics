# openwrt-dsl-statistics #
As i got some trouble with my dsl connection one of the possible solutions was to change the router.   
I got an old AVM 3370 with old firmware. So i decided to flash this one with the newest OpenWRT firmware and get perfect statistics with [luci-statistics](https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/luci/luci_app_statistics).   
   
Installation of `collectd+rrdtool` was no problem and soon I got statistics for 
- interfaces
- system load
- memory
and so on.   
   
## The problem ##
But all code samples that are readily available for dsl-statistics did not work.   
This [article](https://forum.openwrt.org/t/openwrt-21-02-dsl-control/89962/23) in the openwrt-forum explains why. There have been several changes in openwrt.   
- `(v)dsl_cpe_control`   

does not exist anymore.   

Furthermore the statistics output of 
`dsl_control dslstat` has an json output different to the outputs before.   

Additionally the `collect-mod-exec` module, which allows to call user defined scripts, does not allow root access, which is neccessary to call `dsl_control dslstat` or `ubus call dsl metrics`.

## The solution ##
### Whitelisting the ubus call ###
Copy the file `dsl.json` to `/usr/share/acl.d/dsl.json`.
This allows the `dsl_stats.sh` script to read the dsl metrics as user nobody.
I don't know how to apply this change without rebooting, so just do that.
   
### Filling the rrd database ### 
The script `dsl_stats.sh`, which is called by the module `collect-mod-exec`, decodes the json format of the data using the library `/usr/share/libubox/jshn.sh`.
   
You can save the script wherever you want, but better not in folders that do not survive a reboot.
I mounted a usb-stick to also keep my statistics data there. That is also my place for the script. 
Also do not forget to make it executable by user nobody: `chmod +x dsl_stats.sh`.
  
   
### Creating the graphs ###
As the systems does not know how to present data of user defined scripts, the javascript `exec.js` has to do that.   
This script must be saved in the folder `/www/luci-static/resources/statistics/rrdtool/definitions/`.   
**ATTENTION**: If there is already a script `exec.js` you should not override it, but add the code.   

A look at my first data:   
![dsl-statistics](./assets/dslstatistics.png)   
and the data after first reconnect with errors.   
![dsl-statistics-1day](./assets/dslstatistics_1day.png)   

There is even much more data in the json file.   
I tried, to find out, which are important for analysing errors.   
If I forgot essentials, let me know.
